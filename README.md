# hand-gesture-recognition
Overview:
In this project, I built and trained a convolutional neural network for recognizing American sign language gestures using PyTorch. The test accruacy is 79.4% using a simple 2 layer CNN model. 
I also extracted featured using Transfer learning with AlexNet, and built and trained a classifier using the extracted feature as inputs. The transfer learning model has a test accuracy of 91.1%. 

Skills and techniques involved:
- data generation and cleaning
- Pytorch (CNN, loss function, activation function, gradient descent optimizer, etc.)
- Sanity check (overfit on small dataset)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- validation and testing
- Transfer learning with AlexNet
